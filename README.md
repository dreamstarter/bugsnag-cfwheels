bugsnag-cfwheels
================

A very basic Bugsnag notifier for CFWheels.

I will be the first to concede that there is probably a much better way to accomplish this. However, I had a few legacy projects that I wanted to integrate with Bugsnag so I wrote a quick little script to handle this in production environments.

This is meant to be a drop in replacement for **events/onerror.cfm**.
